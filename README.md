# 🌅 Dawn - DePIN Project

Welcome to the **Dawn** repository — an open, decentralized initiative pioneering the future of **DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks)**.  
Our mission is to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds by enabling real-world infrastructure to be owned, powered, and rewarded through blockchain technology.

## 🚀 What is DePIN?
**DePIN** stands for **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks**.  
It transforms how infrastructure is built, funded, and maintained by:
- Incentivizing communities to deploy and operate real-world devices.
